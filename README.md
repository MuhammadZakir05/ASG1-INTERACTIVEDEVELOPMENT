# ASG1-INTERACTIVEDEVELOPMENT
Project Name: Ye.
 This project is a website where I promote the artist, Kanye West. Kanye West is an african american singer rapper who gained popularity in the early 2000s, with some of his notable hits winning him grammies. I intended to make this website to show his albums, past tours and upcoming tours and to feature his very own company, Yeezy.

Design Process
 Kanye doesn't really have his own website dedicating to his albums and tours. However, he has a clothing store yzy.com. I want the index page to display his albums, dated by year and designed so that it will capture anybody's attention. I went in with not much reference except my own figma mockup I did. The Stage page is just a page dedicating to his past tours and his upcoming ones, this is to notify those who are interested in the upcoming tours or wants to know what his previous tours is about.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

As an avid listener of Kanye West, I want to share his music all around. Despite him being showed as rude in the recent years, He is still a human who made good music in the past. My goal is to share around the albums from Kanye West, showing how great he is as an artist.

Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Feature 1, transition upon hovering. I had to use AI for this as I was not familiar with it. Essentially this feature is to show the user that they are hovering a specific album.

Feature 2, Snackbar/toast, I made it so that when you are clicking on an album, a snackbar will appear, showing the album selected.

Feature 3. A music bar. Similarly to the snackbar, this bar is at the very bottom of the page. I got this reference off of spotify where when you play a music, your music will be at the bottom. When you click on an album, it will show "Now playing" with the album name.

Feature 4. Call to action button on albums. I made it so that users have to click the "Listen" album to activate the music bar and the snackbar. This Call to Action makes it so that visitors have to interact with the website other than just scrolling.

Feature 5. The vision page. This page highlights Kanye's career as a vision. I added a quote by him that seems appropriate where he talked about life.

Feature 6. "Integrating" his shop into the website. I want this entire website to be dedicated to him, so I added a page where users can "buy" from the website with his very own brand, Yzy. this page is a grid where it shows the products and the costs.

Testing
 In the Index/Discography page, hover over any albums, a transition should take effect where the selected album will hover up with a drop shadow. Upon clicking the "Listen" button A snack bar should appear on the bottom of the screen. At the bottom of the screen, A bar will be there, highlighting what album is played.
